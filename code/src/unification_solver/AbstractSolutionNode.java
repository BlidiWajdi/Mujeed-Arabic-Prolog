 *         The strategy implied by AbstractSolutionNode is straightforward. It
 *         saves the substition set with which it was created as the context of
 *         its subtree. It then creates new substitution sets to complete the
 *         solution. This allows backtracking to the original substitution set
 *         (original state).
 * 
 *         It also keeps pointers into the rule set, remembering the last rule
 *         tried. When these pointers "run off the end" of the rule set, the
 *         node has finished its search, causing backtrack to the parent.
 * 
 *         Essentially, solution nodes are analogous to stack frames in the
 *         search.
