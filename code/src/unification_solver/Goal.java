 * The method getSolver() returns a solver for the particular type of goal. The
 * getSolver method takes as arguments the rule set, which enables searching on 
 * the different rules, and the substitution set in the parent solution.
 * 
 * An earlier version of this used a Factory pattern to return solution nodes. 
 * This required testing on type of the goal to determine the proper solution node
 * to return. Because testing on types is often considered poor style, we chose to make 
 * each goal return the appropriate node.
